# Projective probability

## Background and motivation
- General hypothesis: The projectivity of some content is not due to conventional specification but rather derived from the conventional meanings of sentences and general principles of rational conversation.
	- Simons et al 2010, Beaver et al 2017: Utterance content projects iff it is not at-issue. (Projectivity Principle)
	- Tonhauser, Beaver & Degen JoS: Utterance content projects to the extent that it is not at-issue. (Gradient Projectivity Principle)
 - To identify whether utterance content is at-issue, we have to identify the Question Under Discussion addressed by the utterance. What, for instance, are factors that influence whether a speaker who utters "Joyce didn't discover that the foundation was cracked" does so with the assumption that the foundation is cracked (i.e., the QUD is whether Joyce discovered it) or with the assumption that there was a discovery but it is not clear what that discovery amounted to (i.e., the QUD is what was discovered). 
 - Previous research suggests listeners can rely on prosody to constrain speaker's QUDs of utterances (Cummins & Rohde 2015, Tonhauser 2016, Stevens et al. 2017). 
 - Tonhauser et al ms (Journal of Semantics) showed that projectivity is predicted by at-issueness, the expression that projective content is associated with and world knowledge about the eventuality described by the clause that lexicalizes the projective content. Follow-up work:
 	- Taylor Mahler's QP1 investigates the hypothesis that listeners can rely on contextual cues to the QUD, to identify whether content projects.
	- The project described here investigates the hypothesis that listeners take world knowledge about the prior of eventualities into consideration to identify whether speaker's are committed to the contents of clauses that describe the eventualities

## Research hypothesis

Our goal in this project is to investigate the hypothesis that the projectivity of clausal content is influenced by the prior probability of the event described by the clause that conveys the content: higher probability of the event results in higher projectivity of the content. To investigate the hypothesis, we manipulate the prior probability of events described by clauses and investigate the projectivity of the content of those clauses.  

The projective content that we use to investigate the hypothesis is the content of clausal complements of attitude predicates: we hypothesize that a higher prior probability of the events described by those clauses results in higher projectivity of the content of those clauses. Since the extent to which the content of the clausal complement of the attitude predicate is entailed content may influence projectivity, we also control for the extent to which the content of the complement is entailed. We will thereby also be able to identify how the extent to which the complement is entailed interacts with the effect of prior probability on projectivity.

## Prior and posterior probability of eventualities

- Eventualities are described by sentences like "Mary is pregnant".
- Interlocutors in a discourse have prior probability (belief) distributions over eventualities: e.g., the prior probability of the eventuality described by "Mary is pregnant" is an interlocutor's subjective belief that this state holds (at the topic time) before considering some evidence (e.g., hearing a sentence that describes the eventuality). 
- The prior probability (or: prior) of an eventuality depends on world knowledge: e.g., the state of Mary being pregnant is lower if Mary is an 8-year old girl (and the interlocutor whose prior we are concerned with is aware of this) than if Mary is a 25-year old woman (and the interlocutor whose prior we are concerned with is aware of this).
- In this experiment, we control the prior of eventualities by presenting information about the world, in the form of 'facts': e.g., given Fact 1, the state of Mary being pregnant has a higher probability than given Fact 2. 
	
	- Fact 1: Mary just walked into an OBGYN's office.
	
	- Fact 2: Mary is a 6-year old girl.
	
- In this experiment, we are interested in the posterior probability distribution that listeners (the relevant interlocutors) have for eventualities after taking into account the relevant evidence, which are i) facts about the world, and ii) the speaker's choice of attitude predicate in their utterance of a complex sentence that embeds a clause that describes the eventuality.
- The uttered sentences are polar questions in which an attitude predicate (with a third person subject) embeds a clause that describes the relevant eventuality. The attitude predicates differ on two dimensions: i) the extent to which the content of the clausal complement is entailed, and ii) the extent to which the content of the clausal complement is projective. These two dimensions are not independent: more projective complements are also more likely to be entailed.
- Thus, more specifically, we hypothesize that, in our main (projectivity) experiment, the extent to which listeners take speakers to be committed about the relevant content (i.e., the probability which they take the speakers to have for the eventuality described by the content) depends on i) facts about the world, and ii) the attitude predicates of the uttered sentences. 

## Background on entailment

- Entailment is a relationship between two sentences, or between a sentence and a proposition: sentence A entails sentence/proposition B iff every situation in which A is true is a situation in which B is true. In other words, "entailment" is defined as a context-independent, binary, categorical relationship (and we do not intend to change that).
- However, for some attitude predicates, remarks have been made to the extent that the content of the clausal complement may be felt to follow from unembedded sentences in many though not all contexts. Schlenker (2010:139) about "announce": "in some contexts, it does not entail the truth of its complement; in other contexts, it entails and presupposes the truth of its complement."Äù For instance, he suggested that whether the content of the complement of "announce" is judged to be entailed depends on who the attitude holder is; e.g., "Mary announced that she is pregnant" seems to be judged to entail that Mary is pregnant if Mary is a sane, adult woman but not if Mary is 8 years old.
- Anand & Hacquard 2014 suggest that there are predicates that at first glance seem veridical (i.e., entail the content of the complement), but really are not, on closer inspection. Similarly, Swanson (2012) didn't take the content of the complement of "establish" to be entailed though other speakers might argue that "ÄúThe detective established that Margret didn't kill James" entails that Margret didn't kill James.
- Haven't worked through this: Sudo (2012): Ph.D. thesis supposedly argued that some triggers don't entail the presupposition.
- So, for semanticists, finding one situation in which the content of the clausal complement does not follow from an unembedded sentence with an attitude predicate or realizing that one can say "a falsely predicate p" (which implies that p is not true) is sufficient to say that the predicate does not entail the content of the complement.
- For naive language users, however, predicates may differ in the extent to which the content of the clausal complement is taken to follow from unembedded sentences with the predicate. We take "veridicality" to be a possibly gradient notion and define it as the extent to which the content of the clausal complement follows from unembedded sentences with the predicate. Exploring the veridicality of different attitude predicates is an interesting project of its own: 
	- Is veridicality a gradient property? 
	- Are predicates that entail the content of the clausal complement highly veridical? 
- Some authors assume that only entailed meanings are presuppositions: non-entailed meanings that speakers are taken to be committed to are considered a completely different phenomenon (e.g., Anand & Hacquard 2014: "Äúillusion of factivity" and "illusion of projection"). 
- In our experiments, we explore whether the extent to which the projectivity of the complement is influenced by the prior of the eventuality described by the complement differs with the extent to which the clausal complement veridical (i.e., we ask: is there an interaction between prior probability and veridicality?).

## Three separate experiments
1. prior probability
2. veridicality 
3. projectivity

## Prior probability experiment

- Goal: to identify readers' prior probabilities of the eventualities described by main clauses, given a fact about the world
- The eventualities should be non-gradable and non-subjective (**JD FILL IN WHY, PLEASE**)
- For each eventuality, we identify its prior given one of 2 facts about the world: one fact in which the eventuality has a higher prior probability, though not at ceiling, and one in which the eventuality has a lower prior probability, though not at floor. 
- We need to avoid eventualities being too likely or too unlikely because a) if they are too likely, then people might argue that the facts of the world entail the content of the clause describing the eventuality, and b) if they are too unlikely, then participants might give wonky projectivity ratings.
- Response task: Participants assess the likeliness of the eventuality described by a main clause, given a fact about the world
	- Fact: Mary just walked into Planned Parenthood.
	  
	  How likely is it that Mary is pregnant?
- Response on slider from 0/very unlikely to 1/very likely
- Materials: 20 atomic main clauses that lexicalize the eventualities, presented with one of two facts each, i.e., 40 stimuli total
- Each participant rates the likeliness of 20 unique eventualities, given a fact about the world.
- We want at least 20 ratings per eventuality/fact combination.
- Analysis: For each eventuality, we calculate the mean likeliness, which we take to be the mean prior probability: the higher the mean likeliness, the higher the prior probability of the eventuality. In the projectivity experiment, we use those eventualities for which the two facts result in a relatively high (though not at ceiling) prior and a relatively low (though not at floor) prior.

## Entailment experiment

- Goal: to identify the extent to which the content of the clausal complement of an (unembedded) attitude predicate is entailed
- The clausal complements are the 20 clauses for which we established facts in the prior probability experiment that result in the eventualities described by these clauses to have a higher versus a lower prior.
- The attitude predicates are categorized by their veridicality and the projectivity of the content of their complement. [DO WE NEED TO HAVE ALL FOUR COMBINATIONS EQUALLY OFTEN? SEE TABLE BELOW]
- Response task: Given the standard definition of entailment (see above), we need a task that probes the extent to which the attitude sentence can be true and the content of the clausal complement false, i.e., the extent to which the content of the clausal complement is not entailed by the attitude sentence. 
- Contradiction task: 
	
	Bill: Steve believes/announced/discovered/knows that Marge is pregnant, but I know that she isn't. 
	
	Does Bill sound like he is contradicting himself?
- Response on slider from 0/no to 1/yes
- Materials: atomic sentences with 20 attitude predicates, 20 clausal complements per predicate 
	
	==> 400 stimuli total 
- Each participant sees each attitude predicate with a unique clausal complement. If we want 10 ratings per combination, we need 4,000 ratings total.
- For each predicate, we calculate the mean contradiction rating: the higher the mean contradiction rating, the more veridical the predicate is.
- Results: We expect to find that contradictoriness is not a binary but a gradient property. This would not mean that "entailment" (the technical term from semantics is gradient), but that a predicate whose clausal complement is not entailed may be more or less "veridical" (if we re-define "veridicality" as a gradient property).

## Projectivity experiment

- Goal: to identify the extent to which participants take the speaker to be committed to the content of the clausal complement of an attitude predicate realized in a polar question, given a fact about the world.
- Response task: "certain that" diagnostic (from Journal of Semantics paper)
	- Fact: Mary just walked into Planned Parenthood.
	  
	  Bill: Did Sue discover that Mary is pregnant?
	
	  Is Bill certain that Mary is pregnant?
- Response on a slider from 0/no to 1/yes
- Materials: 20 polar questions formed from sentences with attitude predicates that embed a clausal complement, given a fact

==> 800 stimuli (20 predicates x 20 complements x 2 facts)
- Each participant rates the projectivity of the content of the clausal complement for each attitude predicate with a unique clausal complement given a unique fact.
- For each predicate/clause/fact triple, we calculate the mean certainty rating: the higher the mean certainty rating, the higher the projectivity of the content of the clausal complement.

## Linear mixed-effects model we want to fit to results of projectivity experiment

	projectivity ~ prior * entailment + (1 + prior * entailment | participant) + (1 + prior | predicate)

where
- projectivity: individual participants' projectivity ratings between 0 and 1, of utterances given facts about the world that manipulates the prior probability of the eventuality described by the content of the complement 
- prior: mean prior probability rating (between 0 and 1) of the eventuality when it is described by a main clause given facts about the world that manipulate the prior probability of the eventuality
- entailment: mean contradictoriness rating (between 0 and 1), i.e., the extent to which the predicate is veridical

Motivation for including interaction term: We hypothesize that projectivity is predicted by the prior. According to classical analyses of presuppositions, non-entailed complements do not project, they at best give the "Äúillusion of projection"Äù. We, however, hypothesize that the projectivity of non-entailed complements will be influenced by the prior, too. We include the interaction term because we hypothesize that for less veridical predicates the predicate itself exerts less control over whether the speaker is taken to be committed to the content of the complement than for more strongly veridical predicates. 

[Perhaps also include as fixed or random effects: tense of attitude predicate?]

## Results and discussion

- We expect to find:
	- significant main effect of "prior": complement clauses that describe eventualities with a higher prior are more highly projective than complement clauses that describe eventualities with a lower prior
	- significant main effect of "entailment": complement clauses of more veridical predicates are more highly projective than complement clauses of less veridical predicates
	- significant interaction: the effect of the prior is stronger with less veridical predicates than with more veridical predicates

- NEED TO RELATE THIS TO A THEORETICAL PREDICTION: at-issueness theory of projection, conventional theory of projection, etc.

## Stimuli
	
**20 predicates**

Explanation for table:
- Projectivity column: 
	- "yes":  predicate is generally taken to be factive or we have evidence that it is
	- "no": predicate is generally taken to be non-factive or we have evidence that it is
	- "yes?": evidence is shaky but the complement may be projective
	- "no?": evidence is shaky but the complement doesn't look projective
- Entailment column:
	- "yes": complement is entailed
	- "no": complement is clearly not entailed
	- "no?": complement is not entailed in the strictest sense, but may be taken to be

20 predicates currently in table (from top to bottom):
- 6 predicates that are clearly projective and veridical (yes/yes)
- 1 predicate ("establish") that is probably projective and veridical (yes?/yes)
- 6 predicates that are (probably) not projective and (probably) not veridical (no(?)/no(?))
- 6 predicates that are (probably) projective but (probably) not veridical (yes(?)/no(?))
- 1 predicate that is (probably) not projective but veridical (no/yes)
